# default-hud-edit
The branches in this repo contain a series of tweaks that I made to customize the default Gmod HUD for personal use, but I figured that I'd share them with others who might be interested in the same thing. 

Please note that this replaces the default Gmod fonts in various places and therefore might make legibility more difficult in certain scenarios.
